## Project: Predicting text from images


## Data : Image file (BMP, JPG, PNG)
## Project Overview
In this project, you will apply supervised learning techniques and an analytical mind to accurately read the alphabets from images created in any format. You will first extract the image data into numeric format. Next, you will apply a series of transformations and preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format. You will then evaluate several supervised learners of your choice on the data, and consider which is best suited for the solution. Afterwards, you will optimize the model by adding new features and that fit the model you've selected. Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood, to see just how well it's performing when considering the data it's given.

Steps:
- We capture a text using mobile camera.
- We add that file in the input function in the file in MASTER.ipynb
- The code resizes the image to (100 X 30) and converts that image pixels in numeric data.
- Next, code runs series of tranformations and preprocessing on the data.
- Finally, we have data containing 3002 features associated to each record.
- The ml.py file outputs the result containing the predicted text.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/)



This project contains four files:


- `Curved.csv`: The curved feature prediction dataset.
- `Linear.csv`: The Linear feature prediction dataset.
- `data_image_reco.csv`: The main project dataset. 
- `MAIN.ipynb`: This is the main file where you will be performing your work on the project.
- `LINEAR.py`: A Python file containing machine learning model to predict linearity of the alphabet image.
- `CURVED.py`: A Python file containing machine learning model to predict curvability of the alphabet image.
- `ML.py`: This is the main file where  you will be performing machine learning model to predict final output.
